# ATM-Machine
# ATM System – C++ Console Application

This project is a **basic ATM simulation system** developed in **C++** as part of the **Programming Fundamentals** course during the **2nd semester**.

The program allows a user to **create an account, log in**, and **perform basic banking operations** such as viewing balance and withdrawing money—all via a user-friendly console interface.

---

## Project Objective

To develop a menu-driven program using **C++ fundamentals** such as:

- Functions
- Loops
- Conditionals
- String handling
- Input/Output operations

This project simulates real-world ATM behavior to strengthen programming logic and procedural programming skills.

## Features

- **Account Creation**
  - Enter your name, 4-digit password, and initial balance
  - Simple validation and confirmation prompts

- **User Login**
  - Three login attempts before lockout
  - Password check and user authentication

- **ATM Functionalities**
  - Display current balance
  - Withdraw funds with input validation
  - Quit session

##  Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++  
- **Compiler:** Any standard C++ compiler (e.g., g++, MinGW, Turbo C++)
- **Platform:** Terminal / Console

---

##  File Structure

-  Main source code file containing the entire program logic

##  How to Run

1. Compile the file:
    ```bash
    g++ A2.cpp -o ATMSystem
    ```

2. Run the program:
    ```bash
    ./ATMSystem
    ```

3. Follow the on-screen menu to:
    - Create a new account
    - Log in with username and password
    - View balance or withdraw money
